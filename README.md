## Overview

## Solo Iterative Process

Since this is a single programmer project, the Solo Iterative Process (SIP) is used to manage it. A product backlog, iteration backlog and work log(time log and code defect log) are used as structure of the whole project. The following link contains these logs. They will be updated through the whole development of the project.

The project will consist of three iterations:

* The release for Iteration 1 will be the initialization and design of the package. This includes the research of necessary topics to accomplish the task, design of UMLs and initialization of package files.

* Iteration 2 will consist of the development of the whole algorithm and creation of the workspace. 

* Iteration 3 will release a functioning demo of the project, tests and the documentation.
